# DNA_Methylation_diff_analysis_superager
DNA Methylation differential expression analysis with R package RnBeads.

Reference code for me but also could be useful to others. Also this code was ran through biowulf HPC. This code is provided in the file 'superager_analysis_v4_biowulf_copy.R'. Additionally code for neural network and random forest is attached. This includes hyperparameter tuning, AUC, and other plots for gini index, etc. Finally, postprocessing R script is attached converting RnBeads output into AI readable data.
